## Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. In `bot/` rename `.env.sample` to `.env`.
3. Again in `bot/` edit `.env`.
4. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`. This can be done by passing the `-r` flag to pip followed by the requirements file.
5. `cd bot` and run `core.py`. If you are on linux and want to use the auto updating cog you will have to run it with `start.sh`.
